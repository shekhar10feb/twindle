step 1: from the [twindleco](https://github.com/twindle-co/twindle) to get a copy of that github account in your account.
 
step 2: download vscode/git and connect the github account to it.

step 3: clone the fork from your github account into your vscode/git (now, you can work on either vscode terminal or git but when you want to work on vscode, 
        you have to download the extension called gitlab.)
   
tip:    always remember to work or make changes in a new branch, for this, you have to in th create a new branch and then, work in it like make chnages or add 
        something.
        
        pull request
            What is pull request and why should we raise?
            pull request is just request from the authority, whose application you have forked, and in that forked application, you have done some changes or 
            added some codes. To incorporate those changes in the main file, you have to do a request or raise a pull request(pr) to the authority. So, just making 
            some meaningful changes and save it in your account won't be beneficial until those changes are addee in to the main file. That's where pull request(pr)
            comes into the picture. 
            
step 4: make a new branch in the github account.

step 5: first go to the new branch, and in that branch go in a file called firstpr of the forked file of twindleco, go there and follow the steps given below: 
        a) click the add file  
        b) click add new file
        c) type a file name with .md as file extensin ( .md means this is a file in markdown format)
           like, ramesh.md and give info about yourself, you can also use markdown to make file looks better. There are some rules for writing markdown.
        d) then, write Create ramesh.md and then, click commit new file.
        
        This file will be save in your account. To incorporate these changes in the main file, you have to raise pr.
        
tip: before raising a pr from the main branch in order to merge your changes into the main file, always update your repository by creating a pull request from twindleco to your account 
     and merge it(make it a habit). And then
