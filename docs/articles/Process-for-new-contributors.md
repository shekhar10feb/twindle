Hi everyone, usually when people connected to an open-source(which is yes, pretty much exciting), they are mostly unware about the 
project. OK, alright! Yes, they have knowledge about the project but they don't have enough knowledge so that, they can contribute 
to it. So, they must have enough knowledge about the project and the process like to do what or where should he/she go first, etc. 
That's where this article comes in handy as suggested by @Proful to write. So, let's go and try to know every process step by step. 

Step 1: From the [twindleco](https://github.com/twindle-co/twindle) to get a copy of that github account in your account.
 
Step 2: Download vscode/git and connect the github account to it.

Step 3: Clone the git repository from your github account into your local machine i.e. vscode/git (now, you can work on either vscode 
        terminal or git but when you want to work on vscode, you have to download the extension called gitlab.). There are different 
        ways to clone a repository into your local machine, like you can use HTTPS, SSH or GitHub CLI and if you are a beginner then, 
        you should use HTTPS, in which you have to copy the code given in the HTTPS then, first make folder in the local machine and 
        after that, using git bash or vscode go into that folder through terminal and paste the copied code with git clone command 
        as shown below:
         
         E:\Program\gitFolder>git clone https://github.com/shekhar10feb/twindle.git

The whole repository will copy in that folder.

Tip:    Always remember to work or make changes in a new branch, for this, you have to in th create a new branch and then, work in it 
        like make chnages or add something.
        
        What is Pull Request and why should we raise?
        Pull Request(PR) is just request from the authority, whose application you have forked, and in that forked 
        application, you have done some changes or added some codes. To incorporate those changes in the main file, 
        you have to do a request or raise a pull request(pr) to the authority. So, just making some meaningful 
        changes and save it in your account won't be beneficial until those changes are addee in to the main file. 
        That's where pull request(pr) comes into the picture. 
            
Step 4: Make a new branch in the github account.

Step 5: First go to the new branch, and in that branch go in a file called firstpr of the forked file of twindleco, go there and follow     
        the steps given below: 
        
        a) Click the add file  
        b) Click add new file
        c) Type a file name with .md as file extensin ( .md means this is a file in markdown format)
           like, ramesh.md and give info about yourself, you can also use markdown to make file looks better. 
           There are some rules for writing markdown.
        d) Then, write Create ramesh.md and then, click commit new file.
        
This file will be save in your account. To incorporate these changes in the main file, you have to raise pr.
        
Tip:    Before raising a pr from the main branch in order to merge your changes into the main file, always update your repository by      
        creating a pull request from twindleco to your account and merge it(make it a habit).
     
     
Step 6: Now, we are ready to raise our first pr as in twindle repository(repo), there is already a folder of same name. So, we need to do     
        this by using our github account by following the steps given below:
   
        - Switch to our new branch
        - Go to firstpr
        - Click on the add file button(on upper right hand side)
        - Click Create new file
        - Give a name of your file like yourName.md, where .md is the name of the markdown extension
        - Now, write about yourself in the space given below. Here, you have to use markdown language.
   
Tip:   Markdown Language is a simple markup language, one can use to format any doucment. If you want to learn basic syntax, you can     
       go here, [Markdown Language](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/).
        
Step 7: for 2nd pr
 
Step 8: for 3rd pr
 
Step 9: for 4th pr
 
Now, you can select any of the section like either you can go to twindle-cli or twindl-web or twindle-thread according to your choice.
